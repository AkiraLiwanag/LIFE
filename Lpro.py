He circled Shokei’s dais three times, shook the ring-staff and stood there bolt upright. Shokei said, “Right, right!” Mayoku then came to Nansen. He circled Nansen’s dais three times, shook the ring-staff and stood there bolt upright. Nansen said, “Not right, not right!” Then, Mayoku said, “Master Shokei said, ‘Right, right!’ Why, Master, do you say, ‘Not right, not right!’?” Nansen said, “With Shokei it is right, but with you it is not right. This is nothing but a whirling of the wind. In the end, it will perish.”', 'Hogen asked Shuzanshu, “"If there is only a hairsbreadth of difference, it is the distance between heaven and earth."[1] How do you understand that?” Shuzanshu said, “If there is only a hairsbreadth of difference, it is the distance between heaven and earth.” Hogen said, “If that’s your understanding, how could you ever attain IT?” Shuzanshu said, “My view is just that. How about you, Master?” Hogen said, “If there only is a hairsbreadth of difference, it is the distance between heaven and earth.” Shuzanshu made a deep bow. [1]: Cited from the Shinjinmei (A Hymn of Sincere Mind), a work by the Third Patriarch Sosan.', 'A monk asked Joshu, “Does the dog have buddha-nature, or not?” Joshu said, “It has” [U]. The monk said, “If it has it, why did it creep into that skin bag?” Joshu said, “Because it does so knowingly.” Another monk asked, “Does the dog have buddha-nature, or not?” Joshu said, “It has not” [Mu]. The monk said, “All living beings have buddha-nature [2]. Why doesn’t the dog have any?” Joshu said, “Because it is in its karma-consciousness.” [1]: see case 1 of Mumonkan: the Shoyoroku case presents a fuller text of the dialogue. [2]: Quotation from the Nirvana Sutra 7, 25.', 'A monk asked Unmon, “Not a single thought arises: is there any fault or not?” Unmon said, “Mt. Sumeru. [1]” [1]: The highest and most massive mountain in the world according to the Indian cosmology.', 'Jizo asked Hogen, “Where are you going, senior monk? [1]” Hogen said, “I am on pilgrimage [2], following the wind.” Jizo said, “What are you on pilgrimage for?” Hogen said, “I don’t know.” Jizo said, “Non knowing is most intimate.” Hogen suddenly attained great enlightenment. [1]: “Senior monk” (joza) is an honorific for a monk who has practiced more than 10 years. [2]: Originally: angya.', 'When Ungan was sweeping the ground, Dogo said, “You are having a hard time!” Ungan said, “You should know there is one who doesn’t have a hard time.” Dogo said, “If that’s true, you mean there is a second moon?” Ungan held up his broom and said, “What number of moon is this?” Dogo was silent. Gensha said, “That is precisely the second moon.” Unmon said, “The servant greets the maid politely.”', 'Ganto came to Tokusan. He straddled the threshold of the gate and asked, “Is this ordinary or is this holy?” Tokusan shouted, “Kaatz!” Ganto made a deep bow. Hearing of this, Tozan said, “Hardly anyone but Ganto could have accepted it that way.” Ganto said, “Old Tozan can’t tell between good and bad. At that time, I raised up with one hand and suppressed with the other.”', 'Whenever Roso saw a monk coming, he immediately sat facing the wall. Hearing of this, Nansen said, “I usually tell my people to realize what has existed before the kalpa of emptiness [1], or to understand what has been before Buddhas appeared in the world. Still, I haven’t acknowledged one disciple or even a half. If he continues that way, he will go on even until the year of the donkey [2].” [1]: One of the “four kalpas” or periods of cosmic changes: the kalpa of creation, the kalpa of existence, the kalpa of destruction, and the kalpa of emptiness. [2]: Since there is no “year of the donkey” in the Chinese zodiac, the expression “until the year of donkey” means endlessly.', 'Seppo, instructing the assembly, said, “There’s a poisonous snake on the southern side of the mountain. All of you should look at it carefully!” Chokei said, “Today in the Zen hall there are many people. They have lost their body and life.” A monk told this to Gensha, who said, “Only Elder Brother Ryo [2] could say something like that. However, I wouldn’t talk like that.” The monk asked, “What then would you say, Master”? Gensha replied, “Why does it have to be ‘the southern side of the mountain’?” Unmon threw his staff in front of Seppo and acted frightened. [1]: see case 22 of Hekiganroku. [2]: i.e. Chokei.', 'One day, Enkan called to his attendant, “Bring me the rhinoceros fan.” The attendant said, “It is broken.” Enkan said, “If the fan is already broken, bring me the rhinoceros himself.” The attendant gave no answer. Shifuku drew a circle and wrote the ideograph “ox [2]” in it. [1]: see case 91 of Hekiganroku. [2]: The Chinese character for “ox” (gyu) is one of the two characters for “rhinoceros” (saigyu = sai + gyu).', 'Kyozan pointed to the snow lion [1] and said, “Is there any [2] that goes beyond this color?” Unmon said [3], “I would have pushed it over for him at once.” Setcho said [4], “He only knows how to push it over, but he doesn’t know how to help it up.” [1]: Probably a lion made of snow or a stone lion covered with snow. [2]: I.e., “anyone” or “anything.” [3]: I.e., later. [4]: I.e., hearing of this.', 'Hogen pointed to the bamboo blinds with his hand. At that moment, two monks who were there went over to the blinds together and rolled them up. Hogen said, “One has gained, one has lost.”', 'A monk asked Gokoku, “How about when a crane perches on a withered pine tree?” Gokoku said, “It is a disgrace when seen from the ground.” The monk asked, “What about when every drop of water is frozen at once?” Gokoku said, “It’s a disgrace after the sun has risen.” The monk asked, “At the time of the Esho Persecution [1], where did the good Guardian Deities [2] of the Dharma go?” Gokoku said, “It is a disgrace for the two of them on both sides of the temple gate.” [1]: Buddhism was suppressed by order of Emperor Bu (about 840). [2]: Nio-figures representing the two Deva kings on each side of the main gate of a Buddhist temple. They are considered to be protectors of the Dharma.', 'When he was staying at the government office of the Province Ei, Fuketsu entered the hall [to preach] and said, “The heart seal [stamp] of the patriarch resembles the activity of the iron ox. When it goes away, the [impression of the] seal remains; when it stays there, the [impression of the] seal is brought to naught. If it neither goes away nor stays, would it be right to give a seal [of approval] or not?” Then Elder Rohi came up and said, “I have the activities of the iron ox. [However,] I ask you, Master, not to give me the seal.” Fuketsu said, “I am accustomed to leveling the great ocean through fishing whales. But, alas, now I find instead a frog wriggling about in the mud.” Rohi stood there considering. Fuketsu shouted “Kaatz!” and said, “Why don’t you say anything else, Elder?” Rohi was perplexed. Fuketsu hit him with his whisk and said, “Do you remember what you said? Say something, I’ll check it for you.” Rohi tried to say something. Fuketsu hit him again with his whisk. The Magistrate said, “Buddha’s law and the King’s law are of the same nature.” Fuketsu said, “What principle do you see in them?” The Magistrate said, “If you do not make a decision where a decision should be made, you are inviting disorder.” Fuketsu descended from the rostrum.', 'A monk asked Daizui, “When the great kalpa fire bursts out, the whole universe [2] will be destroyed. I wonder if IT will also be destroyed or not.” Daizui said, “Destroyed.” The monk said, “If so, will IT be gone with the other [3]?” Daizui said, “Gone with the other.” A monk asked Ryusai, “When the great kalpa fire bursts out, the whole universe will be destroyed. I wonder if IT will also be destroyed or not.” Ryusai said, “Not destroyed.” The monk said, “Why is it not destroyed?” Ryusai said, “Because it is the same as the whole universe.” [1]: see case 29 of Hekiganroku: The Shoyoroku case has an additional part with Ryusai. [2]: Literally: “a billion worlds.” [3]: The word “the other” means “the universe.”', 'Unmon, instructing the assembly, said, “The old buddha and a pillar intersect each other. What number of activity is that?” The assembly was silent. He said on their behalf, “Clouds gather over the South Mountain; rain falls on the North Mountain.”', 'Kyozan asked a monk, “Where do you come from?” The monk said, “I am from Yu Province” Kyozan said, “Do you think of that place?” The monk said, “I always do.” Kyozan said, “That which thinks is the mind [1]. That which is thought about is the objective world. Within that are mountains, rivers and the great earth, towers, palaces, people, animals, and other things. Reflect upon the mind that thinks. Are there a lot of things there?” The monk said, “I don’t see anything at all there.” Kyozan said, “That’s right for the stage of understanding, but not yet for the stage of personalization.” The monk said, “Do you have any special advice, Master?”\
             Kyozan said, “It is not right to say that there is or there is not. Your insight shows that you have obtained only one side of the mystery. Sitting down, putting on clothes, from now on you see by yourself.” [1]: Originally: kokoro.', 'Sansho asked Seppo, “When a fish with golden scales has passed through the net, what should it get for food?” Seppo said, “I will tell you when you have passed through the net.” Sansho said, “A great Zen master with 1500 disciples doesn’t know how to speak.” Seppo said, “The old monk is just too busy with temple affairs.”', 'Fuketsu, giving instruction, said, “If one raises a speck of dust, the house and the nation prosper. If one does not raise a speck of dust, they perish.” Setcho held up his staff and said, “Is there anyone who lives and dies with this?”', 'Rakuho came to Kassan and without bowing stood facing him. Kassan said, “A chicken dwells in the phoenix nest. It’s not of the same class. Go away.” Rakuho said, “I have come from far away, hearing much about you. Please, Master, I beg you to guide me.” Kassan said, “Before my eyes there is no you, and here there is no old monk [1].” Rakuho shouted, “Kaatz!” Kassan said, “Stop it, stop it. Don’t be so careless and hasty. Clouds and the moon are the same; valleys and mountains are different from each other. It is not difficult to cut off the tongues of the people under heaven. But how can you make a tongueless person speak?” Rakuho said nothing. Kassan hit him. With this, Rakuho started to obey Kassan. [1]: I.e., “I.”', 'Great Master Ba was seriously ill. The temple steward asked him, “Master, how are you feeling these days?” Great Master said, “Sun-faced Buddha, Moon-faced Buddha.”', 'Isan asked Kyozan, “Suppose a man asks you, saying, ‘All living beings are tossed in a vast karma-consciousness, and have no foundation to rely upon.’ How would you check him?” Kyozan said, “If such a monk appears, I call out to him, ‘Mr. So-and-so!’ When he turns his head, instantly I say, ‘What is this?’ If he hesitates, then I say to him, "Not only is there a vast karma-consciousness, but also there is no foundation to rely upon."” Isan said, “Good.”', 'Rinzai instructed his assembly and said, “There is one true person of no rank, always coming out and going in through the gates of your face [1]. Beginners who have not yet witnessed that, look! look!” Then a monk came out and asked, “What is the one true person of no rank?” Rinzai descended from the rostrum and grabbed him. The monk hesitated. Rinzai pushed him away and said, “The true person of no rank — what a shit-stick you are!” [1]: I.e., sense organs such as eyes, nose, ears, tongue, etc.', 'A monk asked Joshu, “I have just entered this monastery. I beg you, Master, please give me instructions.” Joshu asked, “Have you eaten your rice gruel yet?” The monk answered, “Yes, I have.” Joshu said, “Then wash your bowls.”', 'Unmon asked Kempo, “May I ask for your answer [1]?” Kempo said, “Have you ever reached this old monk or not?” Unmon said, “If so, I must say I was too late.” Kempo said, “Is that so? Is that so?” Unmon said, “I thought I was Marquis White, but I find that here is Marquise Black [2].” [1]: A literal translation. It is possible to understand the word simply as “instruction.” [2]: Marquis White and Marquise Black are noted thieves in Chinese folklore. Marquise Black, a female thief, seems to have been the cleverer of the two.', 'When he was about to die, Rakuho addressed his assembly and said, “I have one matter to ask you about. If you say ‘yes’ to this, you are putting another head on your own. If you say ‘no,’ you are looking for life by cutting off your head.” The head monk said, “The green mountain always lifts up its legs; you don’t need to carry a lantern in the daylight.” [1] Rakuho said, “What time is this to utter such a saying?” A senior monk named Genjo stepped forward and said, “Apart from these two ways, I beg you, Master, not to ask.” Rakuho said, “That’s not enough. Say some more.” Genjo said, “I cannot say it fully.” Rakuho said, “I don’t care whether or not you can say it fully.” Genjo said, “I feel just like an attendant who has nothing to respond to his master.” [2] That evening, Rakuho called Genjo to him and said, “Your response today had something quite reasonable. You have to realize what our late master [3] said, "There are no dharmas before the eyes, Yet consciousness is before the eyes. IT is not the Dharma before the eyes, IT cannot be reached by eyes and ears."" Which phrase is the guest? Which phrase is the host? If you can sort them out, I will transmit the bowl and robe to you.” Genjo said, “I don’t understand.” Rakuho said, “You must understand.” Genjo said, “I really don’t understand.” Rakuho uttered a kaatz and said, “Miserable, miserable!” [Another] monk asked, “What would you like to say, Master?” Rakuho said, “The boat of compassion is not rowed over pure waves. It’s been wasted labor releasing wooden geese down the precipitous strait [4].” [1]: Most probably a saying formed by Rakuho himself. [2]: Apparently an idiomatic expression meaning, “I can’t describe it in words.” [3]: Rinzai or Kassan. [4]: It was a custom that the boat rushing down the stream through a gorge released pieces of wood ahead as a warning so that a possible crash with the boat coming upstream could be avoided. These wooden chips were called “wooden geese.”', 'A monk asked National Teacher Chu of Nanyo, “What is the essential body [1] of Vairocana Buddha [2]?” National Teacher said, “Pass me that water jug.” The monk passed him the water jug. National Teacher said, “Put it back where it was.” The monk asked again, “What is the essential body of Vairocana Buddha?” National Teacher said, “The old Buddha is long gone.” [1]: The so-called “Dharma-body” or dharmakaya. [2]: The principal Buddha.', 'Razan asked Ganto, “What if things appear and disappear without ceasing?” Ganto scolded him saying, “Who appears and disappears?”', 'A monk asked Master Ho of Koyo, “The great dragon has emerged from the ocean, calming heaven and earth. How will you treat him when he suddenly appears before you?” Master Ho said, “Suparnin [1], the king of birds, absorbs the entire universe. Who can stick his head within him?” The monk said, “But how about when he does appear?” Ho said, “It is like a falcon catching a pigeon. If you don’t realize it, you will learn the truth through the ‘inspection before the balcony.’ [2]” The monk said, “If so, then I’ll fold my hands on my chest and retreat three steps.” Ho said, “You black tortoise under the Sumeru altar. [3] Don’t wait to be struck on the forehead again and get hurt.” [1]: A giant bird that eats even dragons. [2]: A reference to a story in which Heigenkun Chosho, the brother of the king of Cho and a wealthy landlord with 3,000 dependents, built a grand palace with a balcony that overlooked the main road. One day a crippled person was passing by and one of the concubines saw him and laughed. The crippled person was angered and demanded Heigenkun her head. Heigenkun presented the head of an executed convict as the head of the concubine. His dependents knew of his deception, lost faith in their master and gradually all left him. His fortunes declined, so at last he cut off the head of the concubine and presented it for the crippled person to inspect. After that the dependents returned and his fortunes were restored. The story is an allusion to the fact that you can never hide away the real truth. [3]: A reference to one of the four carved figures, representing black tortoises, underneath the Sumeru altar (with the Buddha statue). It is used here as a symbol of someone who has lost the freedom of movement.', 'The Engaku [1] Sutra says: “At all times, you do not raise the delusive mind. When there are all kinds of illusory thoughts, you do not extinguish them. Dwelling in the delusory state of mind, you do not add understanding. Where there is no understanding, you do not distinguish the truth.” [1]: “Engaku” means the perfect awakening of Buddha.', 'Great Master Tokusan Emmyo instructed his assembly and said, “If you have exhausted to the end, you will realize right away that all buddhas in the three worlds have stuck their mouths to the wall [1]. Yet there is still one person ¡© he is giving a great laugh. If you can recognize that person, you have accomplished your study.” [1]: I.e., they are unable to open their mouths.', 'A monk asked Joshu, “What is the meaning of the patriarch’s coming from the West?” Joshu said, “The oak tree there in the garden.”', 'Vimalakirti asked Manjusri, “What does it mean that the Bodhisattva enters the Dharma-gate of Not-Two?” Manjusri said, “I see it like this: in all phenomena, there are neither words nor explanations, neither presentations nor knowledge; it is beyond all questions and answers. That is what I understand with /to enter the Dharma-gate of Not-Two/.” Then Manjusri asked Vimalakirti, “All of us have finished giving our explanations. Now you should give your explanation. What does it mean that the Bodhisattva enters the Dharma-gate of Not-Two?” Vimalakirti remained silent.', 'When Tozan held a memorial service for Ungan before his portrait, he mentioned the episode with the portrait [1]. A monk came forward and asked, “When Ungan said, ‘Just this!’ what did that mean?” Tozan said, “At that time, I almost misunderstood my master’s meaning.” The monk said, “I wonder whether or not Ungan really knew that IT is.” Tozan said, “If he did not know that it is, how could he say like that? If he knew that it is, how did he dare say like that?” [1]: Tozan was still a young monk under Ungan. One day, when he was leaving his master, he asked Ungan, “After your passing, if I am asked by someone whether I have your portrait, what should I answer?” Ungan was silent for a while and then said, “Just this.”', 'When Seppo was living in a hermitage, two monks came to pay their respects. When he saw them coming, Seppo thrust open the gate of his hermitage with his hands, jumped out, and said, “What is this?” The monks also said, “What is this?” Seppo hung his head and retired into his hermitage. Later, the monks came to Ganto. He asked them, “Where have you come from?” The monks said, “From Reinan.” Ganto said, “Did you ever visit Seppo?” The monks said, “Yes, we visited him.” Ganto said, “What did he say?” The monks related what had happened. Ganto said, “What else did he say?” The monks said, “Not a word; he hung his head and retired into his hermitage.” Ganto said, “Oh, how I regret now that in those days I did not tell him the last word! If I had told it to him, no one under heaven could do anything against him.” At the end of the summer practice period the monks came back to this conversation and asked him about its meaning. Ganto said, “Why didn’t you ask me about it sooner?” The monks said, “We could not dare to ask you about it.” Ganto said, “Seppo was born on the same stem as I, but he will not die on the same stem. If you want to know the last word, it is just this.”']

But, like a beautiful flower, full of colour and full of scent, are the fine and fruitful words of him who acts accordingly.", "53. As many kinds of wreaths can be made from a heap of flowers, so many good things may be achieved by a mortal when once he is born.", "54. The scent of flowers does not travel against the wind, nor (that of) sandal-wood, or of Tagara and Mallika flowers; but the odour of good people travels even against the wind; a good man pervades every place.", "55. Sandal-wood or Tagara, a lotus-flower, or a Vassiki, among these sorts of perfumes, the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed.", "56. Mean is the scent that comes from Tagara and sandal-wood;—the perfume of those who possess virtue rises up to the gods as the highest.", "57. Of the people who possess these virtues, who live without thoughtlessness, and who are emancipated through true knowledge, Mara, the tempter, never finds the way.", "58, 59. As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the lily will grow full of sweet perfume and delight, thus the disciple of the truly enlightened Buddha shines forth by his knowledge among those who are like rubbish, among the people that walk in darkness.", "60. Long is the night to him who is awake; long is a mile to him who is tired; long is life to the foolish who do not know the true law.", "61. If a traveller does not meet with one who is his better, or his equal, let him firmly keep to his solitary journey; there is no companionship with a fool.", "62. 'These sons belong to me, and this wealth belongs to me,' with such thoughts a fool is tormented. He himself does not belong to himself; how much less sons and wealth?", "63. The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least so far. But a fool who thinks himself wise, he is called a fool indeed.", "64. If a fool be associated with a wise man even all his life, he will perceive the truth as little as a spoon perceives the taste of soup.", "65. If an intelligent man be associated for one minute only with a wise man, he will soon perceive the truth, as the tongue perceives the taste of soup.", "66. Fools of little understanding have themselves for their greatest enemies, for they do evil deeds which must bear bitter fruits.", "67. That deed is not well done of which a man must repent, and the reward of which he receives crying and with a tearful face.", "68. No, that deed is well done of which a man does not repent, and the reward of which he receives gladly and cheerfully.", "69. As long as the evil deed done does not bear fruit, the fool thinks it is like honey; but when it ripens, then the fool suffers grief.", "70. Let a fool month after month eat his food (like an ascetic) with the tip of a blade of Kusa grass, yet he is not worth the sixteenth particle of those who have well weighed the law.", "71. An evil deed, like newly-drawn milk, does not turn (suddenly); smouldering, like fire covered by ashes, it follows the fool.", "72. And when the evil deed, after it has become known, brings sorrow to the fool, then it destroys his bright lot, nay, it cleaves his head.", "73. Let the fool wish for a false reputation, for precedence among the Bhikshus, for lordship in the convents, for worship among other people!", "74. 'May both the layman and he who has left the world think that this is done by me; may they be subject to me in everything which is to be done or is not to be done,' thus is the mind of the fool, and his desire and pride increase.", "75. 'One is the road that leads to wealth, another the road that leads to Nirvana;' if the Bhikshu, the disciple of Buddha, has learnt this, he will not yearn for honour, he will strive after separation from the world.", "be better, not worse, for those who follow him.", "77. Let him admonish, let him teach, let him forbid what is improper!—he will be beloved of the good, by the bad he will be hated.", "78. Do not have evil-doers for friends, do not have low people for friends: have virtuous people for friends, have for friends the best of men.", "79. He who drinks in the law lives happily with a serene mind: the sage rejoices always in the law, as preached by the elect (Ariyas).", "80. Well-makers lead the water (wherever they like); fletchers bend the arrow; carpenters bend a log of wood; wise people fashion themselves.", "81. As a solid rock is not shaken by the wind, wise people falter not amidst blame and praise.", "82. Wise people, after they have listened to the laws, become serene, like a deep, smooth, and still lake.", "83. Good people walk on whatever befall, the good do not prattle, longing for pleasure; whether touched by happiness or sorrow wise people never appear elated or depressed.", "84. If, whether for his own sake, or for the sake of others, a man wishes neither for a son, nor for wealth, nor for lordship, and if he does not wish for his own success by unfair means, then he is good, wise, and virtuous.", "85. Few are there among men who arrive at the other shore (become Arhats); the other people here run up and down the shore.", "86. But those who, when the law has been well preached to them, follow the law, will pass across the dominion of death, however difficult to overcome.", "87, 88. A wise man should leave the dark state (of ordinary life), and follow the bright state (of the Bhikshu). After going from his home to a homeless state, he should in his retirement look for enjoyment where there seemed to be no enjoyment. Leaving all pleasures behind, and calling nothing his own, the wise man should purge himself from all the troubles of the mind.", "89. Those whose mind is well grounded in the (seven) elements of knowledge, who without clinging to anything, rejoice in freedom from attachment, whose appetites have been conquered, and who are full of light, are free (even) in this world.", "90. There is no suffering for him who has finished his journey, and abandoned grief, who has freed himself on all sides, and thrown off all fetters.", "91.

The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind day and night always delights in meditation.", "302. It is hard to leave the world (to become a friar), it is hard to enjoy the world; hard is the monastery, painful are the houses; painful it is to dwell with equals (to share everything in common) and the itinerant mendicant is beset with pain. Therefore let no man be an itinerant mendicant and he will not be beset with pain.", "303. Whatever place a faithful, virtuous, celebrated, and wealthy man chooses, there he is respected.", "304. Good people shine from afar, like the snowy mountains; bad people are not seen, like arrows shot by night.", "305.

He who says what is not, goes to hell; he also who, having done a thing, says I have not done it. After death both are equal, they are men with evil deeds in the next world.", "307.

As a grass-blade, if badly grasped, cuts the arm, badly-practised asceticism leads to hell.", "312. An act carelessly performed, a broken vow, and hesitating obedience to discipline, all this brings no great reward.", "313. If anything is to be done, let a man do it, let him attack it vigorously! A careless pilgrim only scatters the dust of his passions more widely.", "314. An evil deed is better left undone, for a man repents of it afterwards; a good deed is better done, for having done it, one does not repent.", "315.

Wise people do not call that a strong fetter which is made of iron, wood, or hemp; far stronger is the care for precious stones and rings, for sons and a wife.", "346. That fetter wise people call strong which drags down, yields, but is difficult to undo; after having cut this at last, people leave the world, free from cares, and leaving desires and pleasures behind.", "347. Those who are slaves to passions, run down with the stream (of desires), as a spider runs down the web which he has made himself; when they have cut this, at last, wise people leave the world free from cares, leaving all affection behind.", "348. Give up what is before, give up what is behind, give up what is in the middle, when thou goest to the other shore of existence; if thy mind is altogether free, thou wilt not again enter into birth and decay.", "349.

The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by hatred: therefore a gift bestowed on those who do not hate brings great reward.", "358. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by vanity: therefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from vanity brings great reward.", "359. The fields are damaged by weeds, mankind is damaged by lust: therefore a gift bestowed on those who are free from lust brings great reward.", "360. Restraint in the eye is good, good is restraint in the ear, in the nose restraint is good, good is restraint in the tongue.", "361. In the body restraint is good, good is restraint in speech, in thought restraint is good, good is restraint in all things. A Bhikshu, restrained in all things, is freed from all pain.", "362.

Do not direct thy thought to what gives pleasure that thou mayest not for thy heedlessness have to swallow the iron ball (in hell), and that thou mayest not cry out when burning, `This is pain.'", "372. Without knowledge there is no meditation, without meditation there is no knowledge: he who has knowledge and meditation is near unto Nirvana.", "373. A Bhikshu who has entered his empty house, and whose mind is tranquil, feels a more than human delight when he sees the law clearly.", "374. As soon as he has considered the origin and destruction of the elements (khandha) of the body, he finds happiness and joy which belong to those who know the immortal (Nirvana).", "375. And this is the beginning here for a wise Bhikshu: watchfulness over the senses, contentedness, restraint under the law; keep noble friends whose life is pure, and who are not slothful.", "376. Let him live in charity, let him be perfect in his duties; then in the fulness of delight he will make an end of suffering.", "377. As the Vassika plant sheds its withered flowers, men should shed passion and hatred, O ye Bhikshus!", "378. The Bhikshu whose body and tongue and mind are quieted, who is collected, and has rejected the baits of the world, he is called quiet.", "379. Rouse thyself by thyself, examine thyself by thyself, thus self-protected and attentive wilt thou live happily, O Bhikshu!", "380. For self is the lord of self, self is the refuge of self; therefore curb thyself as the merchant curbs a good horse.", "381. The Bhikshu, full of delight, who is calm in the doctrine of Buddha will reach the quiet place (Nirvana), cessation of natural desires, and happiness.", "382. He who, even as a young Bhikshu, applies himself to the doctrine of Buddha, brightens up this world, like the moon when free from clouds.", "383. Stop the stream valiantly, drive away the desires, O Brahmana! When you have understood the destruction of all that was made, you will understand that which was not made.", "384. If the Brahmana has reached the other shore in both laws (in restraint and contemplation), all bonds vanish from him who has obtained knowledge.", "385. He for whom there is neither this nor that shore, nor both, him, the fearless and unshackled, I call indeed a Brahmana.", "386. He who is thoughtful, blameless, settled, dutiful, without passions, and who has attained the highest end, him I call indeed a Brahmana.", "387. The sun is bright by day, the moon shines by night, the warrior is bright in his armour, the Brahmana is bright in his meditation; but Buddha, the Awakened, is bright with splendour day and night.", "388. Because a man is rid of evil, therefore he is called Brahmana; because he walks quietly, therefore he is called Samana; because he has sent away his own impurities, therefore he is called Pravragita (Pabbagita, a pilgrim).", "389. No one should attack a Brahmana, but no Brahmana (if attacked) should let himself fly at his aggressor! Woe to him who strikes a Brahmana, more woe to him who flies at his aggressor!", "390. It advantages a Brahmana not a little if he holds his mind back from the pleasures of life; when all wish to injure has vanished, pain will cease.", "391. Him I call indeed a Brahmana who does not offend by body, word, or thought, and is controlled on these three points.", "392. After a man has once understood the law as taught by the Well-awakened (Buddha), let him worship it carefully, as the Brahmana worships the sacrificial fire.", "393. A man does not become a Brahmana by his platted hair, by his family, or by birth; in whom there is truth and righteousness, he is blessed, he is a Brahmana.", "394. What is the use of platted hair, O fool! what of the raiment of goat-skins? Within thee there is ravening, but the outside thou makest clean.", "395. The man who wears dirty raiments, who is emaciated and covered with veins, who lives alone in the forest, and meditates, him I call indeed a Brahmana.", "396. I do not call a man a Brahmana because of his origin or of his mother. He is indeed arrogant, and he is wealthy: but the poor, who is free from all attachments, him I call indeed a Brahmana.", "397.
